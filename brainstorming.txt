- Need to find out if there is an API to get board game information
    - BoardGameAtlas
- What other server-side API could we use that would be useful?

Functionality:
- MVP: Ability to search for board games by category, name, price...?
- MVP: Ability to save games owned list (use localStorage)
- MVP: Ability to save games wish list (use localStorage)
- Extra: Ability to create a calendar event for a game night that captures which games will be played.
