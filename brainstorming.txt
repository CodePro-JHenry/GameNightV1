Requirements:
- Need to find out if there is an API to get board game information

- What other server-side API could we use that would be useful?
    - Funny quotes? Keeps with the "fun" theme of gaming.
    - Weather API - useful for scheduling game night dates if games include yard games like cornhole, croquet, bocce, etc. and not just tabletop games

- CSS framework other than Bootstrap: Will use Bulma
